Goal: LED strip reacting to microphone signals.<br>
I prefer to keep it portable, rather than directly feeding it an audio-signal.<br>
<br>
Board: Arduino Uno<br>
LEDs: WS2812B<br>
Sound Sensor: not really a good one - will update if I get myself a proper microphone to connect (preferably with adjustable gain).<br>
<br>
TODOs:<br>
- variable Color: quiet => blue gradually increasing (Hue-wise) up to loud => red.<br>
- instead of blacking out and redrawing everything, gradually decaying the colors, for a smoother look.
